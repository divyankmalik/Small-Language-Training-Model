Introduction

Dive into the world of Language Models as we guide you through the process of training a small language model using GPT-2! This tutorial will explore how to leverage the powerful distilgpt2 transformer to enhance the understanding of diseases and symptoms.

Dataset Loading

Learn how to load a relevant dataset on diseases and symptoms from Hugging Face datasets, ensuring a solid foundation for training your model.

Tokenization and Model Setup

Understand the crucial steps of tokenization using GPT-2's tokenizer and initializing the language model for fine-tuning on domain-specific text.

Training Loop

Walk through the training loop, covering each epoch, monitoring training and validation losses, and ensuring your model learns effectively.

Hyperparameter Tuning

Optimize your model by adjusting batch sizes, learning rates, and other parameters to achieve the best performance.

Text Generation

Experience the power of your trained model by generating meaningful and context-aware text based on input strings.
